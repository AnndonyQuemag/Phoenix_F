  # We can run mix phx.new from any directory to start our Phoenix application. Phoenix will accept an absolute or relative path for our new project directory. Assuming the name of our application is hello, let's run the following command.
    mix phx.new hello
  # Phoenix generates the directory structure and all the files that we will need for our application.
  # When it finishes, it will ask us if we want it to install our dependencies, we put 'y'
  # Once our dependencies are installed, the task will ask us to change to our project directory and start our application.
  # Phoenix assumes that our PostgreSQL database will have a postgres user account with the correct permissions and a password of "postgres".
  # First, cding will return to the hello / directory we just created
    cd hello
  # now we must install npm, and configure the database.
    mix.ecto.create
  # once the database is created, the server is started
    mix phx.server
  # By default, Phoenix accepts requests on port 4000. If we point our favorite web browser to http: // localhost: 4000, we should see the Phoenix Framework welcome page.
